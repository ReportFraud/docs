## Important Notes

- **Single API Key**: Each organization is issued a single API key. If you need to reset or revoke the key, use the **API Key Section** in the Settings page.
- **Integration Use**: Use the API key to integrate your system for report uploads or other functionalities directly via the Reporta API.
- **Security**: Do not share your API key. Treat it like a password and store it securely.
